# Web dev challenge: Pixel Paint

## Running the app

Here is a set up a boilerplate React app (create-react-app) with an express server backend.
Try to run multiple instances to see different clients making changes to the server.

To run it:

- Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
- Launch the dev server and express server by running `npm start` inside `client` and `server` in separate terminals.
- Access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
