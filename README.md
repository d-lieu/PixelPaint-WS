# Web dev challenge: Pixel Paint

## Running the app

We have already set up a boilerplate React app (create-react-app) with an express server backend.
I encourage you to run multiple instances to see multiple users on the server making changes.

To run it:

- Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
- Launch the dev server and express server by running `npm start` inside `client` and `server` in separate terminals.
- Access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
